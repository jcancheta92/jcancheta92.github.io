The main goal of this project was to try my hand at web scraping and I figured web scraping the 2019 Michelin Guide would be interesting to look at.

The Michelin Guide is a book that is published by the tire company, Michelin. This guide details restaurants that offer the highest quality cuisine. The Michelin Guide has a rating of 1-star, 2-star, and 3-star. More stars generally means higher the quality.

The star ratings are defined as detailed by the International Culinary Center:

- One star: The restaurant is considered very good in its category but is limited in some way. This restaurant has a quality menu and prepares cuisine to a consistently high standard, but it may lack a unique element that would bring people back over and over again.
- Two stars: The restaurant has excellent cuisine delivered in a unique way. This restaurant has something exceptional to offer and is worth a detour to visit while traveling.
- Three stars: The restaurant has exceptional cuisine and is worth a special trip just to visit. Rather than being a stop on the way to a destination, this restaurant is the destination. This restaurant serves distinct dishes that are executed to perfection.

Also, there are two other ratings within the Michelin Guide. 'Bib Gourmand' and 'The Plate MICHELIN'.

- Bib Gourmand: Exceptionally good food at moderate prices
- The Plate MICHELIN: Fresh ingredients, carefully prepared: a good meal
