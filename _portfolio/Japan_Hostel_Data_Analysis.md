I came across this library called foliumn that allows for easy data visualization in Python over an interactive map. I wanted to experiment with this tool. I came across this data set on Kaggled called [Japan Hostel Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/koki25ando/hostel-world-dataset). I think it would be fun to experiement with Folium and do some basic exploratory data analysis on this Japanese Hostel dataset because I will be going to Japan very soon and would like to see where most of the hostels in major Japanese cities.
