This will be a collection of all the projects I have completed from the Data Scientist Path at Dataquest. These will act more of a "proof of concept" for my skills as it continues to grow with each completed mission. My goal is to apply all that I have learned into a personal project that I find interesting once I completed the Data Scientist Path. Those will be in a seperate repository, so please keep a look out for them as I continue my journey down the Data Scientist Path.
