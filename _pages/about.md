Iâ€™m someone who has a genuine interest in looking at data to pull insightful information to make more informed decisions. I have previously worked in product management at a technology distribution company and currently working as a sales operations specialist at a technology conglomerate. At each job, I incorporated some data analysis into my work and decided to further my data analytics knowledge. I have a background in Management Information Systems from San Jose State University. Since then I have explored and earned certifications in topics that I am intrigued by such as Predictive Analytics, Data Analytics, and Data Science. I am continuing my learning journey through any avenue possible with the hopes of applying that knowledge to projects that I enjoy.
