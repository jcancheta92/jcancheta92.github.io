I'm someone who has a genuine interest in looking at data with the goal of pulling insightful information in order to make more informed decisions. I have previously worked in product management at a technology distribution company and currently working as a sales operations specialist at a technology conglomerate. At each job, I incorporated some data analysis into my work and decided to further my data analytics knowledge. I recently completed the Predictive Analytics for Business nanodegree at Udacity and the Data Analyst in Python Path at Dataquest. My goal is to complete the Data Scientist in Python Path at Dataquest then apply all that I have learned at every step of my career.
