I am someone who has a genuine interest in telling a story through data analytics and visualization. I have worked at multiple mid to large sized tech companies and incorporated data analysis into my work at each job. I wanted to further my technical skills in data analytics and have earned certifications in topics such as Predictive Analytics, Data Analytics, and Data Science. I am continuing my learning journey through any avenue possible with the hopes of applying that knowledge to projects that I enjoy.
